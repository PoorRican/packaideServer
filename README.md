# Installing

While a Dockerfile is available, running the FastAPI server locally requires that [Packaide (v2 branch)](https://github.com/DanielLiamAnderson/Packaide/tree/v2)
be installed. Follow the instructions provided in the [Packaide README](https://github.com/DanielLiamAnderson/Packaide/tree/v2?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements)
to install locally.
